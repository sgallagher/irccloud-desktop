# IRCCloud Desktop

This is a prototype of an IRCCloud desktop app for Windows, Linux
(Debian/Ubuntu), and macOS. The app wraps the IRCCloud website
in a native window.

This app is currently experimental and is not officially supported,
however it should provide equivalent or better functionality to other
IRCCloud desktop wrapper apps.

If you have any issues, please file them in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/irccloud/irccloud-desktop/issues).

IRCCloud Desktop is built on the Electron app framework, as used by
GitHub's Atom editor. For more information, check out the [Electron
documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.8/).

### Build Requirements
* Node JS version 5.3 or higher
* NPM

On Linux, you also need the `icnsutils` (or `libicns` on Fedora-derived
distros), `graphicsmagick` (or `GraphicsMagick`), and `xz-utils` (or `xz`)
packages.

### Running

Run `npm install` in the root of the repository. `make dev` will run the
app quickly (without icons).

To build a full version, `make dist`.

Instructions for building packages and signed binaries on CI are at [docs/OfficialBuilds.md](docs/OfficialBuilds.md)
